Building the batch mode using VIO. Here I focus on the maths. Later when in realtime mode focus
will be to get it working in selective marginalization mode. That will have more software component
than this one.

Start with reading all data from saved files.
Create states.
Create error states.
Build the problem with residuals and jacobians coded.
Solve the problem to get correct error states.
