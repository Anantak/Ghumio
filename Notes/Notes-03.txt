Alpbach Forum

I have this amazing chance to present Ghumio at Alpbach forum. Goal will be to present a story, not
a technology. I need to know what I want out of the forum. Say I want leads that will get me first
customer and funds to go along. In that case I need to be in a position to present a 'contract'. I
should be able to say that these are the things I can do for your firm and this is how we can setup
a contract. I will go and hire some people too as I go along.
